        <p class="info">
          Mechanical engineering is one of the broadest engineering disciplines—offering opportunities to specialize in areas such as robotics, aerospace, automotive engineering, HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning), biomechanics, and more. Mechanical engineers design, develop, build, and test. They deal with anything that moves, from components to machines to the human body. The work of mechanical engineers plays a crucial role in shaping the technology and infrastructure that drive our modern world.

          Hi, I am Özkan DENİZ
          Mechanical engineering combines creativity, knowledge and analytical tools to complete the difficult task of shaping an idea into reality.This transformation happens at the personal scale, affecting human lives on a level we can reach out and touch like robotic prostheses. It happens on the local scale, affecting people in community-level spaces, like with agile interconnected microgrids. And it happens on bigger scales, like with advanced power systems, through engineering that operates nationwide or across the globe.

          Mechanical engineers have an enormous range of opportunity and their education mirrors this breadth of subjects. Students concentrate on one area while strengthening analytical and problem-solving skills applicable to any engineering situation. Mechanical engineers work on a wide range of projects, from designing engines, power plants, and robots to developing heating and cooling systems, manufacturing processes, and even nanotechnology.
